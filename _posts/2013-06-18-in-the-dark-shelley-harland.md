有些歌，有些声音，第一次听见便深深刻入心里。这首《In the Dark》，是这两天Omega广告的背景音乐，调台时不小心听见了，感觉只有两个字：干净。这么多年，给我这种感觉的嗓子只有三条：Cara Dillon、刘惜君、和她，Shelley Harland。静静夜里静听，与你分享

Here in the dark 
I feel electric 
I sense my skin in between the waves 
I am human, I am criminal 
But I feel life here in my heart again 

Standing in the rain 
Thinking all the way 
To keep these feelings inside 
Walk away from here 
Before the words appear 
I will be silent.. 

Here in the dark 
I feel electric 
I sense my skin in between the waves 
I am human, I am criminal 
But I feel life here in my heart again 

I hide behind the walls 
So you don't notice me at all 
But it hurts me so 
Waiting in the wind 
Whispering the things 
I want you to know 

Here in the dark 
I feel electric 
I sense my skin in between the waves 
I am human, I am criminal 
But I feel life here in my heart again 

Only for you..only for you 
Only you..only you 
Only for you..only for you 
Only you..only you... 

I am human, I am criminal 
But I feel life here in my heart again...
