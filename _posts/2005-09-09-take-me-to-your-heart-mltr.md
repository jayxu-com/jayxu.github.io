Hiding from the rain and snow

Trying to forget but I won't let go

Looking at a crowded street

Listening to my own heart beat

So many people

All around the world

Tell me where do I find

Someone like you girl

Take me to your heart

Take me to your soul

Give me your hand before I'm old

Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart

Take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is - be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart

Standing on a mountain high

Looking at the moon through a clear blue sky

I should go and see some friends

But they don't really comprehend

Don't need too much talking

Without saying anything

All I need is someone

Who makes me wanna sing

Take me to your heart

Take me to your soul

Give me your hand before I'm old

Show me what love is - haven't got a clue

Show me that wonders can be true

They say nothing lasts forever

We're only here today

Love is now or never

Bring me far away

Take me to your heart

Take me to your soul

Give me your hand and hold me

Show me what love is - be my guiding star

It's easy take me to your heart
