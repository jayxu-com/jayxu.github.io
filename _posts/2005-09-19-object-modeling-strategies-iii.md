<strong>Identifying system purpose and features</strong>

A purpose is an overall desired result, the aim of one's actions. Features are specific capabilities for the system under consideration.

This section presents &amp;quotpurpose and features" strategies.

<i><strong>
Str#2. "System Purpose" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

- Develop an overall purpose statement in 25 words or less. Why this system? Why now?

- Keep the overall goal, the critical success factor, always before you.

- "To support, to help, to facilitate, . . ."

<i><strong>
Str#3. "Field Trips, Pictures, and Examples" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

<i></i>- Work with domain experts, ones well-versed in the business.

- Ask for a guided tour; ask for a picture; ask for lots of examples.

<i><strong>
Str#3a. "Multiple Learning Sources" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

- Read about it; try out software for it; listen to domain experts!

<i><strong>
Str#3b. "Build A Glossary" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

- Are you finding that people terms differently? Perhaps using different words to convey the same meaning? Or giving different meanings to the same word? Not a surprise!

- Recommendation: build a glossary using a three-column spreadsheet (term, dictionary definition, project definition).

<i><strong>
Str#4. "Identify Major Sources of Stress" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

- Ask people about the most pressing problems that they face each day. "What stresses you out the most? What frightens you the most? What's the worst thing that could happen to you while your boss is watching?"

- Look for ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of those problems.

<i>
<strong>Str#5. "Develop a Features List" Strategy // identifying purpose and features</strong></i>

- Build a list of features.

- Think through each feature: the feature, who it's for, and why it's important.

- Use qualifiers to narrow the scope of the purpose and features statements.

- Prioritize your features list.

- Use the features list for planning and building frequent, tangible, working results.
