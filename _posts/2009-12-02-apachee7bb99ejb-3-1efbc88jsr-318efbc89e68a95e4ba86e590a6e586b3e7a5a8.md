刚才在Glassfish的Google Group上收到有关Apache在EJB 3.1 JSR表决上投了否决票的消息。<a target="_blank" href="http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/results?id=5029">过去</a>看了一下，发现只有Apache投了否决票，Eclipse、Spring弃权，而且Apache的理由相当牛逼：
<blockquote>
On 2009-11-30 Apache Software Foundation voted No with the following comment:
The Apache Software Foundation's vote is based on the point of view that this spec lead - Sun - is in violation of the JSPA

http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html

and therefore shouldn't be allowed to lead other JSRs until the above matter is resolved.

This vote is not a comment on the technical merits of the JSR.  If not for the issue of the spec lead, the ASF would have otherwise voted "yes".
</blockquote>
于是又围观了一下<a target="_blank" href="http://www.apache.org/jcp/sunopenletter.html">那封</a>公开信，不亏是Apache，邮件的口气都不一样，比如开头：
<blockquote>My name is Geir Magnusson Jr, and I'm the officer of the Apache Software Foundation (ASF), a 501(c)3 public charity, charged with matters relating to our participation in the Java Community Process (JCP).  I am also the VP of the Apache Harmony project. In this matter I represent the ASF.
</blockquote>还有结尾：
<blockquote>We expect you to offer an acceptable, JSPA-compliant license to us within 30 days, or provide a public explanation of why you cannot do so.
</blockquote>
