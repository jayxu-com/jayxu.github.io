<p>原文在<a href="http://systeminetwork.com/article/ibm-i-modern-windows-and-unix-are-legacy" target="_blank">这里</a></p>
<p>Somehow our industry has become known as &quot;legacy.&quot; A horrible stigma to overcome, isn&#39;t it? But is it justified? Let&#39;s think about this for a moment.</p>
<p>Our current hardware platform is called&nbsp;Power Systems&nbsp;and is the exact same hardware that Watson used when he wonJeopardy: The IBM Challenge. Watson is quite probably the newest, highest-tech, and most advanced computer system in the world. I&#39;ll say it again:&nbsp;Our system runs on the exact same hardware.</p>
<p>Compare that to PC hardware. Today&#39;s PC architecture is still based on the&nbsp;x86 architecture originally introduced in 1978. While it&#39;s certainly true that PCs have evolved a great deal in the last 33 years, they still carry the baggage of their heritage. Every PC, even the latest and greatest, still contains 16-bit registers and operations and is still based on a CISC architecture. The original AS/400 was based on an old CISC-based architecture as well, but unlike the PC, we&#39;ve been able to eliminate the need for hardware compatibility to that older technology.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s not the hardware that makes us legacy, then? Our OS is currently called IBM i but is a direct descendant of OS/400, which was released in 1988. That&#39;s pretty old, isn&#39;t it? OS/400 is really CPF from the S/38 with enhancements, and CPF dates back to 1979. Incredibly old, right?</p>
<p>How does that stack up against the competition, then? The first release of UNIX was in 1969. Hey, that&#39;s 10 years older! Mac OS X is derived from the NeXT and BSD operating systems, which in turn, were derived from UNIX.</p>
<p>Windows is newer, right? All of today&#39;s versions of Windows are descendants of Windows NT, which is the newer type of Windows, versus the now-defunct DOS-based Windows 9X line. Development of Windows NT dates back to 1988, when they were collaborating with IBM and calling it OS/2 NT. So, it&#39;s a bit newer than IBM i, I guess. As we all know, the collaboration between Microsoft and IBM fell apart. Microsoft then hired a group of developers from Digital Equipment Corporation, who built much of Windows NT based on the DEC VMS and RSX-11 architecture. That&#39;s right, Windows is arguably based on RSX-11, an operating system released in 1972. Now saying that Windows is descended from RSX-11 isn&#39;t completely fair, because NT is actually more closely related to PRISM, an unreleased DEC OS from 1982. But PRISM was based on UNIX.</p>
<p>Our platform runs on the most advanced hardware available today. The operating system may not be young, but it&#39;s not really any older than the competition.</p>
<p>I guess our system is legacy because:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s not what young kids coming out of school are familiar with.</li>
	<li>The 5250 interface makes a bad impression on newcomers.</li>
	<li>The vendors marketing software for other platforms have marketed their stuff as new and our stuff as old.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short:&nbsp;It&#39;s all in the perception.</p>
