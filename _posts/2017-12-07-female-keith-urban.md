<p>今天在Apple Music订阅的乡村频道给我推了这首歌（这首歌哪像乡村了……）。听到第二遍觉得好像也在讲S-H，上网搜了下，果然“was inspired by the Harvey Weinstein sexual assault claims”……</p>

<p>整首歌曲风简单但好听，高潮部分很耳熟，在回忆里捞了半天终于想起是Savage Garden的Truely Madly Deeply，果然欧美pop的黄金时代还是80' 90'啊～现在很多欧美流行歌第一耳朵总能让我想起中学时代听过的老歌……倒是歌词最后一段很智慧：</p>

<pre class="wp-block-verse">[Verse 1]
When you hear somebody say somebody hits like a girl
How does that hit you?
Is that such a bad thing?
When you hear a song that they play saying you run the world
Do you believe it?
Will you live to see it?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor river wild
Baby girl, woman, child
Female

[Verse 2]
When somebody laughs and implies that she asked for it
Just cause she was wearing a skirt
Now is that how it works?
When somebody talks about how it was Adam first
Does that make you second best?
Or did he save the best for last?

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor river wild
Baby girl, woman, child
Female

[Refrain]
Yeah
Female

[Bridge]
She's the heart of life
She's the dreamer's dream
She's the hands of time
She's the queen of kings

[Chorus]
Sister, shoulder
Daughter, lover
Healer, broken halo
Mother nature
Fire, suit of armor
Soul survivor, Holy Water
Secret keeper, fortune teller
Virgin Mary, scarlet letter
Technicolor river wild
Baby girl, woman, child
Female

[Outro]
Mhm
Female</pre>
