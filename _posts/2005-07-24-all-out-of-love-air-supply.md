<div>I'm lying alone with my head on the phone
Thinking of you till it hurts
I know you hurt too but what else can we do
Tormented and torn part
I wish I could carry your smile in my heart
For times when my life seems so low
It would make me believe what tomorrow could bring
When today doesn't really know
Doesn't really know
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong</div>
<div>I want you to come back and carry me home
Away from these long lonely nights
I'm reaching for you
Are you feeling it too
Does the feeling seem oh so right
And what would you say
If I called on you now
And said that I can't hold on
There's no easy way it gets harder each day
Please love me or I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'm all out of love
I'm so lost without you
I know you were right
Believing for so long
I'm all out of love
What am I without you
I can't be too late
To say that I was so wrong
Ah what are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking of
What are you thinking o.................f</div>
